# JavaScript-Tetrisy-game

My goal with this project was to learn Javascript and how to implement it in a browser, and try to make a Tetris-style game, which I feel I have accomplished quite well. The game is rough around the edges but I've gotten a better handle on arrow notation functions, using ternary operators, and a few odds and ends that can make my code more succinct and increase my confidence in programming.

# Development Environment

I wrote this program using Visual Studio Code, printing at first to the console, then to a basic HTML page hosted locally through one of the VS extensions, using an HTML Id to add text to a paragraph tag. It uses Math for RNG and Number for integer checking, but no external libraries.

# Future Work

unlocking higher levels based on score and level selection
better graphics (Actual graphics)
adjust row-counter to disregard order - only what items are present

next version of the game to-do list:
unfinished items from above
element dataType, with ions to add complexity
special powerups based on molecules created
